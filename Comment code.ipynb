I would encourage you to see me before the test to be more prepared for the tests, using office-hours. I can help you to understand the content in a deeper level. Although your average score was 77.4%, I think with some extra help, you can improve your grade, and your understanding of the course material. You struggled to engage in class this semester. You frequently missed assignments and did not engage in class activities. You also didn't communicate with me, nor did you work well with your fellow classmates. I encourage you to try and get things turned in to me more often, and I want you to meet with me if you have any questions and aim to talk in class at least once per class.

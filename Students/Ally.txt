This semester in AP AB Calculus, we covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelliâ€™s Law.

You showed a partial growth in your exam scores. You scored 89.4% on average. Though the score did not reflect how you improved very much, your test scores show that you were improving each time. You also utilized office hour effectively. Thus, you have received A-'s on your exams, including the test you scored 93%.Your participation this semester was admirable. You tried your hardest to complete every assignment I assigned, even if it was particularly challenging. During class, you would not hestitate to contribute to discussions or ask questions. Your participation grade this semester is 92%. 

You were a very hard worker this semester. You always tried to get everything done, no matter how long the assignment was. You were a very communicative student, which I appreciated very much. If you did have any issues or difficulties, you would not hestitate to reach out to me or ask a fellow student. 

The jump in difficulty level from precalculus to AP Calculus is significant, and you have excelled with this increased challenge. You have earned an 89.4 for the semester and I look forward to your continued success during the remainder of the year.

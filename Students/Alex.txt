这个学期我们学了更难的东西。我们学了学校，汽车，还有电脑的汉子。我们也复习了不同的词语。We learned more difficult vocabulary this semester. Our vocabulary units included school, cars, and computers. We also reviewed some common grammar concepts. 

You have a bit more difficulty on your performance of in-class exams; you have recieved B range score in most tests, including an 56% of your final exam. I would encourage you to see me before the test to be more prepared for the tests, using office-hours. I can help you to understand the content in a deeper level. Although your average score was 77.4%, I think with some extra help, you can improve your grade, and your understanding of the course material.You struggled to engage in class this semester. You frequently missed assignments and did not engage in class activities. You also didn't communicate with me, nor did you work well with your fellow classmates. I encourage you to try and get things turned in to me more often, and I want you to meet with me if you have any questions and aim to talk in class at least once per class. Your participation grade in class this semester is 56%. 

You did have some difficulty understanding some of the concepts, and I could tell you struggled with some of the assignments. Good job persevering through all the challenges. I would recommend you meet with me more. That way I could help explain and guide you through some of the tough areas. 

The jump in difficulty level from Chinese I to Chinese II is significant, and you have excelled with this increased challenge. You have earned an 77.4 for the semester and I look forward to your continued success during the remainder of the year.

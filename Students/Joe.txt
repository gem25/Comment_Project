This semester in AP AB Calculus, we covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelliâ€™s Law.

You faithfully completed the exams and fully engaged in the preparation of the exam. As a result of your hard work, your average score of the exams was 88.6%. This score showed a professional understanding of the contents; thus you have received A's on most tests, including the test you scored 100%.Your participation this semester was admirable. You tried your hardest to complete every assignment I assigned, even if it was particularly challenging. During class, you would not hestitate to contribute to discussions or ask questions. Your participation grade this semester is 99%. 

I enjoyed your sense of humour and positive in my class. I felt it really made a positive difference every day. An attribute that I noticed in you was your independence. Not having to rely on others can be a useful skill, but don't hestitate to reach out to me or any of your friends if you ever have any questions or concerns.

The jump in difficulty level from precalculus to AP Calculus is significant, and you have excelled with this increased challenge. You have earned an 88.6 for the semester and I look forward to your continued success during the remainder of the year.
